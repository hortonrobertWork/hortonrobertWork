Hi There!
My name is Robert Horton. I am a physics graduate with a masters degree in theoretical physics. My areas of expertise are statistical mechanics, non-linear complex systems, pattern formation, criticality and chaos. Most of my academic career has been the simulation and analysis of macroscopic systems. I have created this Github to showcase my dissertation project and some projects I have worked on since graduating to give any interested parties an insight to my capabilities.

Aside from science, I am also passionate about music and art. It is my opinion that good science is rather 'art-like' anyway. This includes making pretty simulations of fluids and granular matter using various propietry software packages and adding soundtracks. If you're interested in this, please send me a message.
